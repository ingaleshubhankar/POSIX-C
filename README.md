# Threads in C using POSIX (pthreads)
Multithreading is one of those topics that feels complicated not because it is large, but because it is usually explained in fragments. APIs come first, rules come later, and understanding is expected to appear somewhere in between.
<br>
This guide takes a different approach.

The guide progresses in small, intentional steps. Each section introduces one idea, explains why it exists, and only then shows the minimum code required to make it concrete. Examples are kept short and focused, and nothing is introduced without a reason. If a concept does not help you understand execution more clearly, it is left out.
<br>
This is not a performance guide, and it is not a collection of recipes. The goal is understanding, not shortcuts. By keeping the scope narrow and the explanations precise, the guide aims to make multithreading feel logical rather than intimidating.
<br>
If you already know C and want to understand how threads actually behave inside a process, this guide is meant to be read from start to finish. By the end, POSIX thread APIs should feel natural, because the behavior they express will already make sense.
